Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is the greatest goal scorer of the 21st century. He has what it takes to beat Wayne Gretzky’s career goal record.
With the start of the 2019-20 NHL season just a couple weeks away, Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is entering the season just 236 goals behind the all-time leader in goals scored for a career, Wayne Gretzky. Ovechkin will match or break this record before he hangs up the skates.

A lot of things can happen in the unpredictable world of sports. Especially in sports as physical as hockey. Injuries happen sadly and some of them derail entire careers. I have never been one to make a prediction of this magnitude as there are too many variables that go into something like this actually happening, but I feel safe and comfortable making this prediction.

Ovechkin is entering his 15th season in the NHL and no one has been the standard of consistency like The Great Eight. He has failed to reach the 40 goal plateau in a season just four times in 14 seasons. In fact, Ovechkin has scored 50 goals in a season more times (eight) than he hasn’t (six).

One of those seasons (2012-13) he didn’t get at least 40 goals was a lockout-shortened season. He still had 32 goals and only played in 48 games. That is the only season he has failed to play in less than 70 games in a season. Ovechkin would be a monster in any era. Health-wise he seems impervious to the wear and tear that normal humans feel throughout a season.

No player has demonstrated more sheer determination to be the best than Ovechkin has in his career. You could see him at times during their Stanley Cup-winning season, hoisting the entire Capitals team and fan-base onto his shoulders and carry them to the next game or round.

14 seasons in any professional sport is a solid career. To perform at the rate of Ovechkin season in and season out is extraordinary. He just turned 34 on Sept. 17. So seeing that most players start to slow when the age meter turns to 30, you would expect to see Ovechkin’s numbers declining.

Instead, his numbers have yet to decline. Ovechkin finished the 2018-19 season with 51 goals. Through fourteen seasons, Ovechkin is averaging 47 goals a season. He has scored over 50 goals in over half of his seasons. That is remarkable and suggests that even with a natural decline in production Ovechkin is poised to make a chase for Wayne Gretzky’s career goals record a reality.

Let’s do the math here – say that he continues to average 47 goals a season. That puts Ovechkin at breaking the record at age 39 in just over five seasons. Now I don’t see him scoring 47 every season from now until the record is broken, but I believe he is going to have north of 50 goals the next two or three seasons.

That would put him at over 150 of the 236 needed to surpass the Great One and leave around 80 or so goals to score over the next two to three seasons. This is doable for no other human being other than the Great Eight.

It’s going to be fun to track as the time ticks by. He will definitely land in the top five of all-time, but I honestly feel that if someone is to ever touch a record of the Great One, it is The Great Eight’s for the taking.

Ovechkin is showing no signs of slowing down. He is that generational talent that has the genetic make-up and mental fortitude to do something others have deemed impossible. I never thought I’d see someone even sniff a record of Wayne Gretzky’s, but here we are today, potentially five years away from seeing the Great 8 supplant the Great 1 as the all-time leader in goals scored!

Alex Ovechkin pushed me down a rabbit hole
Last night, the Washington Capitals sniper (and keg-stand enthusiast) pulled even with Joe Sakic and Jarome Iginla for 15th on the NHL's career goals list with 625. Those are two all-time greats, so it got me thinking about the best goal scorers in the history of hockey. And that sent me down an internet rabbit hole. Here are my favourite takeaways:

Ovechkin is the greatest goal-scorer of all time. Let's just do this right now. Ovechkin has scored 0.609 goals per regular-season game — a slightly better rate than all-time goals king Wayne Gretzky. Yes, Gretzky's ratio is dragged down by the last few years of his career, when his skills had diminished. That happens to everybody. It'll happen to Ovechkin. But Gretzky also played during a much higher-scoring era. When 99 potted a record 92 goals in 1981-82, the average NHL game had eight goals. Ovechkin will probably catch Gretzky's 894 goals, and it's much harder to score now.

And he isn't going to stop. All of the dozen-plus guys ahead of Ovechkin have scored their last NHL goal. He's still going strong. That's why you have to look at goals per game. And only three guys in the modern era with at least 200 goals have scored at a higher clip than Ovechkin: Mike Bossy, Mario Lemieux and Pavel Bure. So why aren't they better than Ovi? Here's a cute way to say it: sure, they were all star shooters, but they were also shooting stars (too cute?).
Relatively speaking, we barely saw them. Injuries shortened all their careers.

Bossy, who played in that high-scoring Gretzky era, finished with 52 fewer goals than Ovechkin already has. Bure gets credit for his tougher environment but he's 188 goals (and counting) short of Ovi. Lemieux's total of 690 goals will almost certainly be passed by Ovechkin — maybe as soon as next season.

Ovechkin is possibly a robot. A really fun robot. Sure, it seems unfair to dock the other guys for their health problems. But on the flip side, Ovechkin's machine-like durability is one of his great skills. He's played in an incredible 97 per cent of his team's regular-season games since he arrived in the NHL. That should count.

The best goal-scorer in NHL history is Alex Ovechkin. This is something observable, as teams have had over a decade to defend his shot, only to find it virtually indefensible. This is something quantifiable, as Ovechkin has 613 career goals at 33 years of age. If this is another 50-goal season for Ovi, he could rank as high as 13th all-time by the end of it. As we discussed last season, if Ovechkin averages 36 goals annually over the next eight seasons, that would put him at 896, or two more than Wayne Gretzky's career total. That's not impossible, although it's also not probable. We'll put that squarely in the "reasonable to speculate" category.

But this is also something contextual. Simply put, Alex Ovechkin is doing this in an era with the best athletes in NHL history and against goaltenders who, while not exactly a collection of Dominik Haseks and Martin Brodeurs these days, have much better technique and refined coaching than the cardboard standups Gretzky used to put pucks behind. (Not to diminish Gretzky's ability, mind you, but comparing the training modern goalies have with those in the 1980s is like comparing a laser surgeon with a house call doc holding a bag of leeches.)

Provided he remains healthy -- and the Russian Machine rarely breaks -- we could be witnessing the best chance to see someone shatter Gretzky's record, after Mario Lemieux lost his to his body and Jaromir Jagr lost his to lockouts and the lure of KHL riches. Whatever his end total, in Ovechkin we're witnessing the reign of the NHL's most dominant goal-scorer.

Chris Peters, hockey prospects analyst: I'm going with Mike Bossy, with Ovechkin a very close second. I think Ovechkin is probably one of the game's best pure shooters and I was 3 years old when Bossy retired, but looking at the numbers, what Bossy did is mind-blowing. The fact that he ended up playing only 10 seasons when a bad back cut his career short is all that probably keeps him from being the no-brainer in this discussion. Bossy topped 50 goals in every season but his last, and topped 60 five times. He's the NHL's all-time leader in goals per game (minimum 300 games played) and had a career shooting percentage of an absurd 21.2 percent. Yes, goalies were stopping pucks at a far lower rate in Bossy's prime, but he was special even by that era's standards. One wonders what would have happened had he stayed healthy for longer.

You can make arguments that Bossy's lack of longevity either disproportionately helps his case or hurts it, with his unrivaled per-game rates taking the place of still-great, but maybe not eye-popping, raw numbers. That's one thing that I think gets undersold about Ovechkin -- just how durable he's been, which probably should be part of the discussion in what has made him so special. It also further complicates the comparisons.

Greg's point on the era of goaltending we're currently in is well taken. I think that plays a huge role in the overall discussion and definitely puts Ovechkin among the absolute elites of this sport. I just think if Bossy was able to continue playing, there was a really good chance Gretzky would have been chasing someone besides Gordie Howe when he was going for the all-time goal-scoring record.

Ben Arledge, associate editor: It's Alex Ovechkin, but I think it's actually pretty close, and the guy for me who gives him a run for the money isn't Wayne Gretzky or Mike Bossy or Mario Lemieux. It's a guy who sits tied for No. 67 on the all-time goals list.

If you look strictly at goals per game, Pavel Bure is fifth all-time in the NHL at 0.623, just ahead of Ovechkin (0.608). Watching highlights of Bure's dominant 12-season run in the NHL, he was playing at a level all by himself. Nicknamed the Russian Rocket, he had Connor McDavid's speed, Ovechkin's shot and Patrick Kane's handles. Thrice leading the NHL in scoring, Bure had two 60-goal campaigns and three additional 50-plus seasons. Even in the Dead Puck era, he compiled 437 goals, but was held to barely 700 career games -- over 300 fewer than Ovechkin has played -- while battling knee injuries for most of his career. If he were able to stay healthy, who knows where he'd be on the all-time goals list. And really, if you think I'm crazy even mentioning him, go watch some highlights and remind yourself of his insane ability to light the lamp in the 1990s. Because it truly was something special.

All that said, Bure is edged out in my book by Ovi. He actually does a lot of the same things that made Bure so unstoppable, but he's been doing it longer and against the most technically sound goaltending hockey has ever seen. There is no defending him from the left circle, and there is no defending him as he drives to the net. His strength, on top of the ridiculous speed, soft hands and an absolute hammer of a shot, is what separates him. Bure went around you. Ovechkin will go around you or through you, whatever it takes to get into a position to score. And once he's there, there's no one who finishes better than him. And like Bure, he didn't do it in 1980s, when teams were scoring nearly four goals per game. There's a reason Ovechkin still potted 49 in his age-32 season, and it's no shocker that he has six goals in six games this season. Plain and simple, you are watching the greatest ever at finding the back of the net.
Yeah, ain’t nobody stopping that.

Once Jordan Staal left the penalty box, Ovechkin screamed at him as he made his way off the ice.

The goal was Ovechkin’s 24th goal of the season and the 682nd of his career. He is now three goals shy of passing Selanne (684) for 11th all-time.

In terms of PPGs, Ovechkin only trails Dave Andreychuk and Brett Hull.

Alex Ovechkin isn’t participating in the NHL’s All-Star Weekend, but he still was a topic of discussion during the festivities.

The 34-year-old Russian ended the first half of the season on a tear, scoring eight goals in the Capitals’ final three games before the break, including consecutive hat tricks that left him tied with Steve Yzerman for ninth on the NHL’s all-time goals list at 692.

It was the third time Ovechkin had scored hat tricks in back-to-back games. He joined Wayne Gretzky (three times) and Joe Malone (four times) as the only players to score hat tricks in consecutive games more than twice.

Ovechkin’s recent hot streak further illuminated what has been on the minds of many of his observers for most of his career: Will he break Gretzky’s all-time goals record?

For “The Great One,” it’s quite realistic that “The Great Eight” breaks what was once thought to be an insurmountable record. Ovechkin trails Gretzky by 202 goals.

“I’m a big believer that records are made to be broken,” Gretzky told NHL.com on Friday. “What I accomplished, I’m very proud of. It’s hard to do what I did, and it’s really hard to do what he’s doing now. But there’s no question in my mind that he has a real legitimate chance of doing it. The two things that you need; you’ve got to stay healthy, and he’s proven that over his career. He plays hard, and he stays healthy. And secondly, you’ve got to be on a good team — and he plays on a good team.”

Alex Ovechkin ready to retire ‘right away’ if he breaks Wayne Gretzky’s goal record

If Ovechkin happens to break Gretzky’s mark, the Hall of Famer wants to see it in person.

“I think it would be wonderful for the game,” Gretzky said. “Anything that’s positive is always good for the game. I said jokingly to Sergey [Kocharov, the Capitals’ vice president of communications] … I said I hope [Capitals owner Ted Leonsis] realizes that when I was chasing Gordie’s record, Gordie and Colleen got to fly on the team plane. I hope I get invited to fly on the team plane because I would love to be at the game.”
Gordie, of course, refers to the legendary Gordie Howe, whose 801 goals stood as the NHL record for 14 years until Gretzky claimed the title of the NHL’s most prolific goal scorer in 1994.

Ovechkin has 692 goals in 1,133 career games, a clip of one goal scored in 61.1 percent of his games. He’s averaging about 50 goals per 82-game season, which puts him on pace to surpass Gretzky’s record during the 2023-24 season. Ovechkin will be 38 then, the same age Gretzky was when he scored his final goal in 1999.

Ovechkin needs two goals to tie Mark Messier for eighth on the all-time list (694) and 16 to tie former Capitals star Mike Gartner (708) for seventh. He is tied with Toronto’s Auston Matthews for second in the NHL with 34 goals this season, trailing only Boston’s David Pastrnak, who has 37. Another 16 goals would not only tie Ovechkin with Gartner on the all-time list, it would secure Washington’s captain his ninth 50-goal season, tying him with Gretzky and Mike Bossy for the most in league history.

Alexander Mikhailovich Ovechkin (Russian: Александр Михайлович Овечкин, IPA: [ɐlʲɪˈksandr ɐˈvʲetɕkʲɪn]; born 17 September 1985), often referred to as "Ovi", "the Great Eight" and "Alexander the Great", is a Russian professional ice hockey winger and captain of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to entering the league, Ovechkin played for Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague for four seasons, from 2001 until 2005, and returned to play for them briefly during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. With the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Ovechkin remained in Russia until 2005, joining the Capitals for the 2005–06 season. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, scoring 52 goals and 54 assists to lead all rookies with 106 points and finishing third overall in league scoring. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of his generation.
Ovechkin has won the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL's leading goal scorer, an NHL-record eight times. His first such title came in 2007–08, when his 65 goals and 112 points also earned him the Art Ross Trophy for most points scored, the Hart Memorial Trophy for most valuable player, and the Lester B. Pearson Award for best player as voted on by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). Ovechkin would again win the Richard Trophy, Hart Trophy, and Pearson Award in 2009; he won the Ted Lindsay Award (the renamed Pearson Award) for a third consecutive year in 2010, which also marked the fifth straight year Ovechkin was named to the First All-Star Team.

After some years of decreased scoring, Ovechkin reclaimed the goal scoring title in 2013, earning the Richard Trophy and his third Hart Trophy. He would repeat as the Richard Trophy winner in 2014, 2015, and 2016, scoring at least 50 goals each season and becoming only the third player to score 50 goals in seven different seasons. Ovechkin reached 600 career NHL goals in 2018 and is considered one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history.[1][2] In 2017, Ovechkin was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players of all-time.[3] After ten playoff runs with the Washington Capitals, Ovechkin won his first Stanley Cup in 2018 over the Vegas Golden Knights, as well as the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player in the 2018 playoffs.

Internationally, Ovechkin has represented Russia in multiple tournaments. His first IIHF tournament was the 2002 World U18 Championship. The following year he made his debut at the World Junior Championship, helping Russia win the gold medal. He played two more years at the World Juniors, as well as once more at the World U18 Championships. Ovechkin's first senior tournament was the 2004 World Championship, and he also played in the World Cup that year. Ovechkin has also played for Russia at the Winter Olympics in 2006, 2010, and 2014. Overall, Ovechkin has represented Russia at eleven World Championships and three Olympics in his career, winning the World Championship three times.

The Conn Smythe Trophy was introduced in 1964 by Maple Leaf Gardens Limited to honor Conn Smythe, the former owner, General Manager, and coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder.[1] The centerpiece of the trophy is a stylized silver replica of Maple Leaf Gardens, the arena built under Smythe's ownership of the Maple Leafs, and their home from 1931 to 1999. Backing the arena replica is a large silver botanically-accurate maple leaf. The arena replica and leaf are set atop a square wooden foundation, the front of which bears a dedication plaque. Additional tiers below the foundation, sloping outward, contain maple leaf-shaped plates bearing the inscriptions of the winners' names.[2]

The base of the Conn Smythe Trophy has been expanded twice over the years to accommodate more winners. Although the 16 nameplates on the original base tier were filled up after 1980, a new tier was not added until the 1983–84 season. Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 nameplates on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' nameplates were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining nameplates shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004–05 season, the trophy wasn't filled up again until 2010, after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.

The first winner of the trophy was center Jean Béliveau of the Montreal Canadiens in 1965. The first player and only defenseman to win it twice was Bobby Orr, who scored the Cup-clinching goals for the Boston Bruins in 1970 and 1972. Goaltender Bernie Parent (for the Philadelphia Flyers) and centers Wayne Gretzky (for the Edmonton Oilers), Mario Lemieux, and Sidney Crosby (for the Pittsburgh Penguins) have also won it twice each, with Parent, Lemieux, and Crosby each winning theirs back to back (1974/1975, 1991/1992, and 2016/2017 respectively). Goaltender Patrick Roy is the only player to win the trophy three times, and also the only player to win it as a member of two different teams (with the Canadiens in 1986 and 1993, and with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001); his wins also fall into three different decades. Ken Dryden, the 1971 Smythe winner, is the only NHL player to win this trophy before winning the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year (in 1972): Montreal called him up to play only six regular season games, which is not enough to qualify as a rookie season. Dave Keon's eight playoff points in 1967 is the fewest ever by a non-goalie Conn Smythe winner, as he was a defensive forward and is the only Maple Leafs player to win the trophy donated by his club's parent company.

Though the trophy rewards a player who performed particularly well over the entirety of the playoffs, it has never been given to a player whose team did not at least reach the Stanley Cup Finals. The trophy has been awarded to members of the team that lost the Finals five times, most recently Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in 2003, who backstopped his team's surprise run to the Finals, where they pushed the New Jersey Devils to seven games. The only skater to win the award in a losing effort is Philadelphia's Reggie Leach, who won it in 1976 as he had set a league record for most goals in the playoffs (19), which included a five-goal game in the semifinals and four goals in the Finals, even though the Canadiens swept his Flyers.[3]

Only eight players born outside of Canada have won the Conn Smythe Trophy. The non-Canadian winners are Americans Brian Leetch, who won it in 1994, Tim Thomas in 2011, Jonathan Quick in 2012, and Patrick Kane in 2013; Russians Evgeni Malkin and Alexander Ovechkin, who won it in 2009 and 2018, respectively; and Swedes Nicklas Lidstrom and Henrik Zetterberg, who won it in 2002 and 2008, respectively.

Only three players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player during the regular season in the same year: Orr in 1970 and 1972, Guy Lafleur in 1977 and Wayne Gretzky in 1985. These three players also won the Art Ross Trophy as regular season leading scorer, while Orr also won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman to give him a record four individual original NHL awards in 1970.[1][4]

As of 2019, the Conn Smythe Trophy has been awarded to centers 19 times, to goaltenders 16 times, to defencemen nine times, and to right wingers seven times, while the only left wingers to have won the award are Bob Gainey of Montreal in 1979 and Alexander Ovechkin of Washington in 2018. The Montreal Canadiens have received the most Conn Smythe Trophies with nine. The Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins have each received five, and the Edmonton Oilers, Philadelphia Flyers, and New York Islanders have each received four.

Ovechkin is considered by many as the greatest goal scorer in NHL history,[94] with what some consider a real chance at overtaking Wayne Gretzky in total career goals (894).[95][96] He's famous[97] for his deadly one-timer,[98] which he typically fires from the left faceoff circle[99] — an area known as his "office".[100] Former teammate Brooks Orpik said of his one-timer, "You know it's going there, and you still can't stop him."[99] Ovechkin proves "the exception rather than the rule when it comes to success" on one-timers, which "can be very difficult to pull off" — involving as they do "taking a hard pass and timing a shot perfectly, when the puck may be rolling or on end, while also aiming at a small net, particularly from far distances."[101]

Ovechkin has been awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy honoring the most valuable player in the league three times (2008, 2009, 2013). Ovechkin's most enduring nickname is "Great 8".[102][n 5]

The truth is that we are witnessing one of the most amazing players in NHL history, even if not all of us understand that yet.[103]

— Kevin Allen, USA Today, November 2015
There are so many good players in the league you can find comparables to. Ovie is different than everybody in the league. I could find a lot of guys that are more similar to Sid. Ovie is one of a kind.[104]

— Brooks Orpik on Ovechkin vs. Sidney Crosby, ESPN, June 2018
Ovechkin's ability to shoot heavily as a power forward[105][106][107] has been well documented. After clinching the hardest shot title at the 2018 NHL All-Star game skills competition with a 98.8 mph first attempt, he became the only player in the 2018 All Star game to break the century mark — surpassing 100 mph on his second shot[108]—stepping "up to plate and delivered a blistering 101.3 MPH blast."[109]

But I tell you, when you get on the ice with him and you see his shot for the first time, it's crazy. It's so, so hard. When I shoot, I can see my puck. When he shoots ... Oh, come on. Where's the puck?[110]

— Evgeny Kuznetsov on Ovechkin, December 2015

Guys like Ovi shoot it so hard that it's almost like you're a batter in baseball. You see the blur of the puck coming at you in frames.

— Jonathan Quick, July 2015

In an October 2018 game against the Canucks, after Vancouver had pulled their goalie, Ovechkin passed the puck to teammate T. J. Oshie rather than score the easy hat trick for himself. "[Oshie asked] 'Why you pass me the puck?'" Ovechkin said. "But he was so wide open and I try to give him pass. Save mine for next time."

The Capitals' morning skate ritually begins with captain Ovechkin "sprinting around the rink, a solo lap to the sound of sticks tapping from his teammates." Once he's made it all the way around, the rest of the team jumps onto the ice to join him. Ovechkin is known as a durable player, losing little time to injuries. After being struck on the foot by a teammate's wrist shot during a 2006 game in Vancouver, he "crumpled to the ice and had to be helped to the locker room." Exhibiting no ill effects in practice the next day, Ovechkin famously told reporters, "I'm okay; Russian machine never breaks."

Late in the 2008–09 season, Ovechkin garnered some criticism over his exuberant after-goal celebrations. On 28 February 2009, during a segment of Hockey Night in Canada's Coach's Corner, Canadian hockey analyst Don Cherry likened Ovechkin's celebrations of jumping into the boards and his teammates to that of soccer players, concluding that this was not the Canadian way and advising Canadian kids to ignore Ovechkin's example. Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau came to Ovechkin's defense, stating Cherry "doesn't know Alex like we know Alex", and Ovechkin himself stated that he "doesn't care" about Cherry. The next notable incident happened on 19 March 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring his 50th goal of the season, Ovechkin put his stick on the ice, pretending to warm his hands over it because it was "hot." The incident sparked an immediate response from Tampa Bay coach Rick Tocchet, who said that "[Ovechkin] went down a notch in my books." Boudreau had also stated that he would discuss the incident with Ovechkin, and teammate Mike Green, despite being the first to celebrate with Ovechkin afterwards, commented that he did not wish to join in the pre-meditated celebration. Ovechkin himself was unapologetic, and said about Don Cherry in particular, "He's going to be pissed off for sure...I love it!."

After using and endorsing CCM equipment for most of his career, Ovechkin made the move to Bauer Hockey in August 2011 — following a decline in his point production in the 2010–11 season. He continued to use Bauer equipment until the 2017 season, when he switched back to CCM. Ovechkin currently uses the Ribcor Trigger stick and Super Tacks AS1 skates.

It is a well known "fact" that Sidney Crosby is a whiner.

In February 2009, a NHL Players' survey was distributed and according to 52 percent of the players, Sidney Crosby was the "player who complains the most on the ice."

 I can't tell you how many T-shirts, pictures, YouTube videos, etc. are online with statements that hint towards Crosby being a "girl" or "cry baby" and other explicit content.

A famous occurrence of Crosby complaining to a referee is when Ovechkin scored a hat-trick goal in the 2008-2009 playoffs.

When asked what he said to the referee, he replied: "People kept throwing hats, I was just asking if [the referee] he could make an announcement to ask them to stop.. for us we just wanted to make sure we kept kinda moving and got the game going we wanted to try and get back into it."

But if Crosby were to get a hat-trick, do you think any other player would have acted the same way that he did?

Ovechkin, on the other hand, gets his fair share of ridicule, but still has a positive reputation.

He's the NHL "class clown." In the NHL 2009 All-Star Game's Superskills Breakaway Challenge, Ovie went to the sideline and gathered up a pair of sunglasses and a hat with a Canadian flag from fellow Russian Evgeni Malkin to close out his portion of the challenge.

However, Ovechkin also knows when to be serious too.

Constant chattering and rooting for his teammates while on the bench can be heard in various YouTube clips and on wired moments for specific games.

Teams are going to want leadership from a serious player who just plays the game, not from a player who whines to the referee every time a call doesn't go her— I'm sorry, HIS way.

Alex Ovechkin shifted away from his normal office on the power play and retreated to the point at the blue line awaiting the pass. When it came, he fired the one-timer at Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray.

Murray managed to get a pad on the puck, but the power behind the shot sent the rebound out to John Carlson who potted the puck before Murray could recover. Ovechkin collected an assist on the play for his 1,200th career point, pulling him into a tie for 48th all-time in NHL history.

Sitting one spot ahead of him at No. 47 with 1,206 points is Sidney Crosby who hit the 1,200-point mark exactly one week before.

After 14 NHL seasons, six points are all that separate the two rivals as both have put together careers that will cement them among the all-time greats.

“I'm just amazed at how consistent both of them have been near the top of the league in scoring,” said Matt Niskanen, who has been with the Caps since 2014 and who spent four seasons playing with Crosby in Pittsburgh. “Every year for over a decade, they've just produced and produced. It really is amazing just how lethal they've been for so long.”

Some rivalries are created by playoff matchups, others are born of bad blood stemming from a dirty play in a game. If you ask either Ovechkin or Crosby, they see the rivalry between as just an extension of the Capitals and Penguins rivalry. Neither player seems to enjoy talking about the other or about competing against one another.

“I don’t like turning it into me and him,” Crosby said to Josh Yohe of The Athletic.

That attitude is not surprising given how the competition between both players was thrust upon them.

The Ovechkin, Crosby rivalry was artificially created, the product of an attention-grabbing storyline of two generational players entering the league at the same time. Whether they want to admit it or not, however, that rivalry has grown into one of the all-time great rivalries of the NHL and perhaps in sports.

“It'll go down as the greatest one-on-one, player-on-player rivalry that we've had since Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky,” former player and current NBC Sports analyst Jeremy Roenick said. “And that's even a little bit different too because Mario and Wayne were on opposite conferences, they didn't play each other as much as we've seen Sidney and Ovechkin. So I think it goes even on a bigger par, on a bigger status than maybe their two rivalries had during the '80s and '90s.”

Ovechkin first entered the NHL in 2004 when he was selected at No. 1 overall by Washington in the draft. He took the league by storm with two goals in his NHL debut. With 52 goals and 106 points in his rookie season, it was clear the Caps had received a generational talent. Washington has become a powerhouse franchise in the NHL with Ovechkin leading the way. He took over as team captain in 2010. The way he plays and the way he leads can often stand in stark contrast to the typically buttoned-down NHL.

“He shows up every night and brings a lot of energy to the table,” Carl Hagelin said. “He's loud, he's always excited. I think he gets you going. He's been great.”

Crosby was the No. 1 overall pick for Pittsburgh the year after Ovechkin in 2005. A native of Nova Scotia, Crosby’s career began with high expectations from a hockey crazy Canada. He quickly established himself as the next great player for a Penguins team that had struggled since the decline of Lemieux. Crosby was the next player to wear the C after Lemieux and has brought a new era of dominance to Pittsburgh.

“Just tireless worker,” Niskanen said. “Plays the game hard. Obviously has a ton of talent and all that, but his motor just never stops going. He's just always going. He's usually the best practice player, he has the most detail, constantly working on his game. He's pretty impressive that way.”

Though both the captains of their respective teams, they lead in completely different ways.

“They're different, but they both find a way to be successful,” said Brooks Orpik, who played with Crosby for nine seasons and who is now in his fifth season with the Caps. “I think if one guy tried the other guy's routine or path, it probably wouldn't result in success and that's just the way it is. It's hard to find many similarities.”

A lockout erased the 2004-05 season meaning that despite both being No. 1 overall picks, they both made their NHL debut in the same season in 2005.

From a media perspective, it was a match made in Heaven. Two franchise players entering the league in the same year on rival teams. The narrative took off and everyone ran with it.

From the players’ perspective, however, it felt forced.

Ovechkin was from Russia, Crosby from Canada. Both players had played against one another only once in the 2005 World Junior Championship gold medal game. To call the Caps and Penguins “rivals” at that point was also a stretch. Washington’s dislike for Pittsburgh stemmed from a 1-6 playoff record against the Penguins. In 2005, however, both teams were in different divisions and had not played a postseason series since 2001.

“I know from those two guys perspective, it was always external,” Brooks Orpik said. “It was never me vs. that guy. It was always just this team vs. that team.”

But the rivalry tag would not go away.

Both players managed to live up to the impossibly high expectations starting in the 2005-06 season when both players tallied over 100 points and found themselves competing for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. Ovechkin emerged victorious while Crosby finished second. Crosby would go on to win the Hart Trophy the following season as the league MVP. Not to be outdone, Ovechkin would win the Hart in each of the next two years.

For every individual accolade, every milestone one would reach, the other would seemingly respond.

“First couple years of course we was young, we was rookies and we want to prove to the team, to the fans who's better,” Ovechkin said.

But the great rivalries in sports, the games and storylines we remember the most, come from the playoffs. It was not until 2009 that the rivalry stopped being a media-driven narrative and turned into something more than that.

“Probably that first playoff series they played each other, that's where it turned into something real,” Niskanen said.

Sports can be fickle. The matchups we look forward to the most so rarely manage to live up to expectations, but this one did.

In their first postseason meeting, both Ovechkin and Crosby were absolutely brilliant. Ovechkin scored eight goals and 14 points while Crosby tallied eight goals and 13 points in seven games. Ultimately, Crosby and the Penguins prevailed and would go on to win the Stanley Cup that year. Though there could only be one winner, both players emerged as the faces of the league, two young superstars who had managed to live up to every expectation the league, the media and the fans had placed upon them when they were first drafted.

It took another seven years before the two would meet again in the postseason. Now they have played in each of the last three seasons in what has been inarguably one of the most important rivalries in league history. The winner of each series between the Caps and Penguins in the Ovechkin-Crosby era has gone on to win the Cup.

“It's a great rivalry and it's phenomenal for the game, for the growth of the game in both areas,” said Todd Reirden, who has coached both players. “Having lived in both places, you've seen the game grow largely because of those two superstars.”

A rivalry that was once branded as Ovechkin vs. Crosby and was measured by individual achievement shifted over the years. As Crosby continued leading Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs, Ovechkin and the Caps struggled to get past the second round. With every passing year, the number of goals, points and trophies mattered less and less. Suddenly the rivalry became all about one number: Zero.

In 2017, the Caps fell to the Penguins in the playoffs for the second consecutive season and for the third time in the Ovechkin-Crosby era. Ovechkin had yet to beat Crosby in the playoffs and had not won a championship.

When it comes to the all-time greats, players are judged by titles. Dan Marino, Charles Barkley, Allen Iverson, Pavel Bure, Marcell Dionne, Eric Lindros were all great players in their respective sports, but they are all remembered with the caveat of being among the greatest players to never win a championship. Ovechkin was in danger of joining that list, but 2018 changed everything.

For the third straight season, the Caps faced the Penguins in the playoffs. Pittsburgh was the two-time defending champion and stood in the way of Washington’s Stanley Cup dreams. Ovechkin was brilliant again with seven points in six games. In overtime of Game 6, he sprung Evgeny Kuznetsov on a breakaway on the series-clinching goal.  From there, Ovechkin and the Caps simply would not be denied.

The 2018 run to the Stanley Cup changed what was already a tremendous rivalry and made it an all-time great. Ovechkin finally had his championship and he had to go through Crosby to get it.

For his career, Ovechkin has earned three Hart Trophies, three Ted Lindsay Awards as the MVP as voted by the NHLPA, seven Rocket Richard Trophies as the league’s leading goal scorer, one Art Ross Trophy as the league’s leader in points, one Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP and one Stanley Cup. Crosby has two Hart Trophies, three Ted Lindsay Awards, two Rocket Richard Trophies, two Art Ross Trophies, two Conn Smythe Trophies and three Stanley Cups.

But for all their accomplishments, the legacy of both players will be forever linked. You cannot talk about the career of Ovechkin without talking about Crosby and vice versa.  Now, however, the rivalry is not about what Ovechkin has not achieved. He finally earned his validation and with it, turned his rivalry with Crosby into one of the greatest ever. An all-time great vs. all-time great, champion vs. champion.

“You have arguably the best player over the last 12 years in Sidney Crosby and you have not arguably the best goal scorer in this generation in Ovechkin,” Roenick said. “Now that that Cup has been won by Ovechkin, there's always going to be that never-ending debate is who was the better player and it's one that I'm sure will be talked about way more than Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.”

Alex Ovechkin is 211 goals from breaking Wayne Gretzky's NHL record of 894, and Washington Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said the forward has a chance to get there.

"He's not going to be the speed player or rush player he's been in the past, but he's finding ways to score," MacLellan told Sportsnet on Wednesday. "If his shot stays there, I think he has a shot at it."

Ovechkin, who scored twice in a 6-1 win against the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday, entered Washington's game against the against the Philadelphia Flyers at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday (7:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN) with 684 NHL goals, tied with Teemu Selanne for 11th place. He is six from tying Mario Lemieux for 10th and 16 from becoming the eighth player in NHL history to score 700.

But to catch Gretzky, Ovechkin figures to have have to play at a high level for several seasons.

"Health is obviously going to play a big factor," MacLellan said. "He still shoots the puck well. As long as he has the shot, and we have a good enough team surrounding him, and our power play stays in the top 10, he has a chance to play for a long time. I think longevity is the key to him."

A key factor for Ovechkin will be how long he plays. The 34-year-old said during the NHL Player Media Tour in September that he hasn't thought beyond the end of his contract, which expires at the end of next season. He's eligible to sign an extension with the Capitals beginning July 1.

"We'll see what's going to happen in two years," Ovechkin said. "We'll see where we're at and, of course, I want to play until I can't play, you know? I don't want to be a guy who go out there and just, like, you know, plays [like a] joke. If I'm going to be at the same level, yeah [I'll play]."

Ovechkin, who has averaged 0.61 goals per game, would have to score at the same pace for another 344 games -- the equivalent of more than four full NHL seasons -- to pass Gretzky.

"I'm going to have to play until I'm 60 if I want to break that record," Ovechkin told NHL.com last month. "No, I'm joking. We'll see."
The son of famous Soviet era-athletes, Alex Ovechkin was born on September 17, 1985, in Moscow. Widely considered one of the world's top young hockey players by age 17, Ovechkin was selected No. 1 overall by the Washington Capitals in the 2004 NHL Draft, and went on to become one of the league's most explosive scorers.
Alexander Mikhaylovich Ovechkin was born on September 17, 1985, in Moscow, Russia. He's the son of well-known Soviet-era athletes. His mother, Tatyana, excelled at basketball and was a two-time Olympic gold medalist. His father, Mikhail, was a serious soccer player.

Ovechkin's childhood was shaped by modesty. Not long after his birth, he moved with his family to the outskirts of Moscow, making a home in a tall high-rise building that was surrounded by a crumbling neighborhood. To escape his surroundings and strict public school, Ovechkin turned to hockey, pouring everything he had into the sport.

By the age of 16, Ovechkin had begun playing with the Moscow Dynamo, a pro Russian team. A year later, he became the youngest member of Russia's national team.
Spurred to escape a Russian life that had already claimed his older brother, who died in a car crash, and was consuming his friends—many having become addicted to drugs—Ovechkin dreamed of playing in the NHL. In his bedroom, he carefully stashed away the cards of many players, including his idol, Mario Lemieux.

Considered a hockey phenom in his native country, Ovechkin soon earned the praise of NHL scouts. As his game took off, his confidence soared. At the 2002 Under-18 World Championships in Slovakia, the young forward led the tournament with 14 goals in just eight games.

"It's the best hockey there is," Ovechkin said of the NHL. "And I think I'm ready to play there, wherever I'm drafted."
In the end, the highly prized and touted Alex Ovechkin went No. 1 overall to the Washington Capitals in the 2004 NHL Draft.

Forced to miss a year due to the league's season-long lockout, Ovechkin made his NHL debut with a bang in October 2005, potting two goals in just four minutes and checking an opponent so hard that he broke the glass partition. He went on to net 52 goals and register 54 assists that season (2005-06), winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's Rookie of the Year.
In the years since, the Russian superstar has only stepped up his dominance to become one of the NHL's most explosive and feared scorers. During the 2007-08 season, Ovechkin scored 65 times and dished out 47 assists to capture his first Hart Trophy as the league's MVP.

The following season, Ovechkin won the Hart for the second (consecutive) time. He earned a third MVP honor following the 2012-13 season.
In addition to his NHL career, Ovechkin was a key member of two Russian Olympic squads, in 2006 and 2010. Scheduled to play in the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, Ovechkin was tapped as the official ambassador for his home country. As the country's most famous winter athlete, he kicked off the running of the 2014 Olympic torch in Olympia, Greece.
Ovechkin’s mother was a two-time Olympic gold medalist (1976, 1980) as a member of the Soviet women’s national basketball team, and his father was a professional football (soccer) player. Ovechkin’s impressive athletic lineage was evident early in his life, as he played at the highest level of Russian professional hockey at age 16 and was the standout forward for the national junior hockey team by age 17. Ovechkin was selected by the Washington Capitals with the first overall pick of the 2004 NHL draft, but his rookie season was delayed a year by the labour lockout that led to the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. He made his NHL debut in 2005 alongside an even more highly touted rookie, Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but Ovechkin’s 106 points in the 2005–06 season earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.

During the 2006–07 season Ovechkin made his first NHL All-Star Game appearance, but his continued high level of play did not prevent the Capitals from finishing last in their division for the second time in his two years with the team. The following season, however, he led Washington to a surprising division title while scoring 65 goals, which was the first time since 1996 that an NHL player topped the lofty benchmark of 60 goals in one season. The Capitals lost their first-round playoff series, but Ovechkin (who also led the league with 112 points) still won his first Hart Memorial Trophy at season’s end. The Capitals won another division crown in the 2008–09 season, as well as their first postseason series, before being eliminated by Crosby and the Penguins in a dramatic seven-game conference semifinal that featured three overtime contests. Ovechkin again led the NHL in goals scored that season (with 56) and won his second straight Hart Memorial Trophy. Ovechkin led the Capitals to two additional appearances in the conference semifinal round, in 2010–11 and 2011–12 (both losing efforts), but his own level of play fell off substantially, as he netted just 32 and 38 goals, respectively, in those seasons. After a similarly disappointing beginning to the 2012–13 season, he caught fire during the final half of the lockout-shortened 48-game campaign and ultimately led the NHL with 32 goals, which resulted in his third career Hart Trophy win.
Ovechkin again led the NHL in goals scored (51) during the 2013–14 season, but the Capitals’ playoff streak ended at six seasons during that campaign. In 2014–15 he scored a league-high 53 goals and led the Capitals to the postseason, where Washington lost a thrilling second-round series (despite having held a three-games-to-one lead) that saw each of the seven games decided by one goal. In November 2015 Ovechkin registered his 484th career goal to become the NHL’s top-scoring Russian-born player. He finished the 2015–16 season with 50 goals (once again most in the NHL) while leading the Capitals to a franchise-record 56 wins. However, Washington could not capitalize on its top seed in the playoffs and was again eliminated in the second round. Ovechkin posted career-worst numbers in 2016–17 with just 69 points (33 goals, 36 assists), the fewest he had ever tallied in a full NHL season. Despite his mediocre play, the Capitals again put up the best regular-season record in the league, only to once more lose to a lower-seeded team in the second round of the postseason.
In 2017–18 he again led the NHL in goals scored (49) as the Capitals won another division title. In the postseason, Washington finally broke through after years of playoff frustration, capturing the franchise’s first conference title in 20 years to give Ovechkin his first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals. Ovechkin shined in the finals, scoring his 15th goal of the playoffs in a game-five victory over the Vegas Golden Knights that won the Capitals their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Ovechkin thus became the first Russian player to captain a team to the NHL championship. His outstanding postseason performance earned him the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player in the playoffs. Ovechkin had a league-leading 51 goals during the 2018–19 season, during which the Capitals won a fourth straight division title. However, in the following postseason the team again lost in the opening round.
As the "face of the Capitals" for over a decade, Ovechkin had taken "the lion's share of the blame" for the team's failing record postseason — which had included three straight exits during the second round, two of them dealt by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The loss to the Penguins in the 2017 playoffs was particularly devastating to the Capitals. And while Crosby had won three Stanley Cups with the Penguins, Ovechkin was being considered the greatest hockey player never to have won one — with his main nemesis being largely to blame.[63] Advancing age, consideration of his legacy, and the desire to beat Crosby's Penguins in the postseason combined to change Ovechkin's approach to hockey in the 2017–18 season and beyond.[64] After engaging in a more intense pre-season fitness training than usual — focusing more on speed work and condition — Ovechkin returned to training camp in Washington two weeks early and predicted: "We're not gonna be fucking suck this year [sic]." He then scored seven times in the team's first two games[65] — performing a hat trick in both games.[8]

The 2017–18 season appeared to be historic for Ovechkin, who broke many NHL and Capitals' records during the regular season. On 7 October 2017, he became the first player in 100 years with back-to-back hat-tricks to start the season.[66] As well, on 25 November, Ovechkin passed Bondra as the team's all-time leader in hat-tricks with his 20th of his career.[67] On 21 October, in a game against the Detroit Red Wings, Ovechkin surpassed Jaromír Jágr for most regular season overtime goals with the 20th of his career.[68] He extended the record again in December in an overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks.[69]


On 12 March 2018, Ovechkin scored his 600th career goal, making him the 20th player to ever reach such a feat, and the fourth to do so in less than 1,000 games.[70] On 1 April 2018 Ovechkin would play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in his 1,000th regular season NHL game, becoming the first Capitals player to play 1,000 games and the 54th NHL player to do so within the same franchise.[71] At the conclusion of the regular season, Ovechkin was awarded the Rocket Richard trophy for the seventh time in his career.[72] He became the second player, tied with Bobby Hull, to win the NHL's goal scoring title seven times.[73]

During the playoffs, Ovechkin was "in the midst of the most dominant postseason of his career," with 12 goals and 22 points over 19 games, and averaging 21:14 of ice time per game.[74] Once again the Capitals would meet their longtime rivals in the Eastern Conference semifinals — headed up by Sidney Crosby, 33-year-old Ovechkin's main rival as player of his generation.[75] The Penguins had been victorious in nine of the previous 10 encounters.[76] He fed the puck to Kuznetsov for the overtime goal that beat the Pittsburgh Penguins on 7 May to advance the Capitals to the Eastern Conference finals.[77] After 13 seasons in the NHL, Ovechkin competed in his first conference finals.[78]

On 23 May 2018, Ovechkin helped lead the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals for their first time since 1998[79] — going on to help them win their first championship in franchise history.[80] He won the Conn Smythe trophy, awarded to the most valuable player for his team in the playoffs.[81]

In the 2018 playoffs, according to then Capitals coach Barry Trotz:
Ovi's been on a mission. There were a lot of people doubting if he still had what it took. The great players take exception to that. . . I think he took it personally. He said, 'I'm going to show you I'm still a great player.' And he did.[74]

On 7 June 2018 Ovechkin won his first Stanley Cup, leading his team to victory over the Vegas Golden Knights 4–3 in game 5 of the finals. The Stanley Cup victory was the first in the Capitals 44-year franchise history.[n 2] He scored the first Stanley Cup Finals goal of his 13-year, 1,121-game NHL career on 30 May 2018, in game 2 against the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena.[83] He is the first Russian to captain a team to the Stanley Cup.[65][n 3]

In the Capitals' third game of the 2018–19 season against the Vegas Golden Knights on 10 October 2018, Ovechkin scored the 610th and 611th goals of his NHL career to pass Bobby Hull for 17th on the all-time goal list as the Capitals defeated the Golden Knights 5–2.[84] Ovechkin became eighth on the all-time list for power play goals, passing Marcel Dionne, scoring his 235th career with a one-timer against the Pittsburgh Penguins in a 2–1 win on 7 November 2018.[85] His 236th power play goal, scored against the Canadiens during a 19 November 2018 game tied him with seventh-placed Mario Lemieux on the all-time list.[86] Ovechkin scored his 626th career goal in a 6–3 victory over the New Jersey Devils on 30 November, moving him past Joe Sakic and Jarome Iginla for 15th on the NHL all-time goal-scoring list. He accomplished this feat in his 1,028th career game, while Sakic needed 1,378 games to collect his 625 goals and Iginla needed 1,554 games.[87]

On 6 December 2018, Ovechkin became the fastest player in NHL history—and ninth overall—to take 5,000 shots on goal, reaching that mark in only 1,031 career games. Marcel Dionne, the previous holder of the record, required 184 more games.[88] He scored the 21st hat-trick of his NHL career in a 6–2 win over Detroit Red Wings on 11 December, passing Pavel Bure for most by a Russian-born player in league history.[89] Ovechkin extended his point streak to a career-best 14 games in a 4–3 shootout win over the Buffalo Sabres on 15 December.[90] — including back-to-back hat tricks.[91][n 4] Ovechkin was named a captain for the 2019 National Hockey League All-Star Game, but announced that he was choosing to skip the game to rest, forcing him to serve an automatic one game suspension as a result.[92] Ovechkin would be named captain again the next year, and again chose to skip the game to rest, and would serve another one game suspension.[93]
Ovechkin was formerly engaged to tennis player Maria Kirilenko. On 21 July 2014, Kirilenko announced that the wedding was called off and that the two were no longer seeing each other.[150] On 11 September 2015, Ovechkin announced via Instagram his engagement to Nastya Shubskaya (daughter of Vera Glagoleva)[151] whom he subsequently married.[152]

On 7 June 2018, in an interview after winning his first Stanley Cup, it was made public that Ovechkin and his wife were expecting their first child.[153] On 18 August the couple had a son, whom they named Sergei after Ovechkin's late brother.[154]
